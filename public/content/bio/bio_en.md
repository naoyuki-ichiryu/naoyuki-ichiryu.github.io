## Research Focus
My research objective is to directly observe vortices in a type-II superconductor using differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (DPC-STEM).  Magnetic flux penetrating Type-II superconductors forms vortices, which are a crucial factor determining the material's critical current. Therefore, observing and understanding their behavior is vital for improving superconducting wire performance and will significantly contribute to society.
