## Research Focus
My research objective is to directly observe vortices in a Type-II superconductor using differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (DPC-STEM).  Magnetic flux penetrating a Type-II superconductor forms vortices, which are a crucial factor determining the material's critical current. Therefore, observing and understanding their behavior is vital for improving superconducting wire performance and will significantly contribute to society.
